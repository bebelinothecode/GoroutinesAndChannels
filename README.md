# GoroutinesAndChannels

In this project, we explored how to build a simple real-time system using channels and goroutines. Goroutines are lightweight threads that allows us to perform multiple operations concurrently. Channels is a medium to communicate between/among goroutines.

In this project, we build a simple real-time system using goroutines and channels. We have two producers that generate data and a consumer that receives the data.

Download the project and run it using the command : go run main.go

This is just a simple implementation of channels and goroutines but as we know, life is not always that simple so I am going to build more complex projects
